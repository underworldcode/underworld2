"""
Underworld2 is a Python API (Application Programming Interface) which provides 
functionality for the modelling of geodynamics processes, and is designed to 
work (almost) seamlessly across PC, cloud and HPC infrastructure. Primarily 
the API consists of a set of Python classes from which numerical geodynamics 
models may be constructed. The API also provides the tools required for inline
analysis and data management. For scalability across multiprocessor platforms, 
MPI (Message Passing Interface) is leveraged, and for performant operation all
heavy computations are executed within a statically typed layer. 

Underworld2 provides capacity for modelling 2- and 3-dimensional geodynamics 
processes, utilising a particle-in-cell finite element approach  
for solution to Stokes flow type configurations. In Underworld, the finite 
element mesh can be static or dynamic, but it is not constrained to move in 
lock-step with the evolving geometry of the fluid. This hybrid approach allows 
Underworld to obtain accurate velocity solutions (on the mesh) for a given 
material configuration, while simultaneously ensuring the accurate time
advection of material interfaces and history information (using particle swarms).

A primary aim of Underworld2 is to enable rapid prototyping of models, and to 
this end embedded visualisation (LavaVu) and modern development environments 
such as Jupyter Notebooks have been embraced, with the latter also providing 
a path to cloud computing amenability. The Jupyter Notebook front end 
provisioned across cloud facilities has also proven to be an appropriate 
environment for the use of Underworld as a teaching tool for solid Earth 
geoscience.

Underworld2 provides a minimal set of highly flexible core functionality,
with user domain concerns left to the users themselves to construct. At the centre
of this design is the Function class, which aims to provide a natural interface
from which users can describe their problem mathematics. For example, the user may
describe a viscosity which is piecewise constant, temperature dependent, or 
visco-elasto-plastic in behaviour. Simulation chronology is also fully exposed 
and the user is expected to explicitly specify when events should occur. This 
approach allows users to specify exactly their modelling requirements and provides
transparency.

Underworld is an open-source project.
