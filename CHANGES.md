CHANGES: Underworld2
=======================
Release 2.13-dev []

New:
 * UWGeodynamics (`from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO`)
-------------------

Release 2.12.0 [2022-01-31]
---------------------------
New:
 * CMake based builder instead of Scons.
 * Added M1 (arm64) based docker.
Upcoming release
Changes:
 * GitHub actions for CI and docker publications.
 * Compatibility with petsc 3.16.
 * Update Docker images: Ubuntu 21.10 and mpich 3.4.2, python 3.9.2, petsc 3.16
 * Update install_docs/nci gadi

Fixes:
 * Unit fix for temperature saved in celcius.

Release 2.11.0 []
-----------------
Changes:
* Enabled user defined Gauss integration swarms for all systems. 
* Update docker base images: switch to ubuntu(20.04), update petsc(3.14) & mpich(3.3.2), other tweaks. 
* Cleaner Python compile time configuration. 
* Add runtime check for solver availability (for example, 'mumps'). Also add test for check.

Docker image changes:
* Update base image.
* Updated to PETSc 3.15.1
* Updated to MPICH 3.4.2
* Removed petsc4py.
* Switched `/opt` to ugo+rwx to allow users to install Python packages.

New:
* Model for EBA convection, based on King et al. (2010) benchmarks. See `docs/test/14_Convection_EBA.ipynb`
* Mesh/MeshVariable/Swarm/SwarmVariable objects now support loading and saving
  of units information, as well as additional attributes. For usage examples, 
  see `docs/test/mesh_aux.py` and `docs/test/swarm_aux.py`. 
* Added `underworld.function.count()` method, which counts function calls.
* Conda binaries available via underworldcode conda channel `conda install -c underworldcode underworld2`
* Added `underworld.function.count()` method, which counts function calls. 
* Added GADI install/run scripts @ ./docs/install_guides/nci_gadi/
* Updated pull request related documentation and added template.

Fixes:
* Updates for SCons4.1.
* Fix bug where multiple solvers added multiple preconditioners. 
* H5py v3 is more strict in allowed indexing array shapes. Updated our 
  structures to accomodate. 
* Tester uses `jupyter-nbconvert` which no longer defaults to Python. Update
  to explicitly select Python.
* Switched h5 file save to mode "w" instead of "a" as append mode resulted
  in data from previous datasets (with identical name) not being removed from 
  file, and file sizes therefore growing unnecessarily.  

Release 2.10.1 [2020-08-28]
---------------------------
Changes:
* Updating Dockerfile to include UWGeodynamics new docs structure.

Release 2.10.0 [2020-08-07]
---------------------------

Release 2.9.2 [2020-02-26]
---------------------------
Changes:
* Update Zenodo title. 

Release 2.9.1 [2020-02-18]
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Update base docker image & implement permission fixes.
* Other docker tweaks and corrections.
* Fixes for image tests

Release 2.9.0 [2020-01-20]
---------------------------
New:
* Experimental `pip install` functionality.
* Installation instructions for NCI Gadi.
* Singularity usage instruction Pawsey Magnus.
* `UW_VIS_PORT` environment variable flag added to set vis port.

Docker:
* Images now use Python 3.7 (previously Python 3.5).
* Multi-stage builds used improved image creation.
* Images minimised with unnecessary items removed. 
* XVFB no longer required for image generation within
  container.
 
API changes:
* `glucifer` module moved inside `underworld` and 
   renamed `visualisation`.
   Access as `import underworld.visualisation`
* `GLUCIFER_USE_XVFB` -> `UW_USE_XVFB`.
* --prefix=/SOME/DIR now installs to /SOME/DIR/underworld
* `test_basic.py` no longer sets PYTHONPATH
* `underworld.matplotlib_inline()` -> `underworld.utils.matplotlib_inline()`.

Enhancements:
* By default, UW was creating significant filesystem chatter in
  generating debug messages for functions. This has been 
  significantly reduced through judicious usage of Python
  inspection tool. Also, as default, only root proc now generates
  messages. Users can set the UW_WORLD_FUNC_MESSAGES (`export UW_WORLD_FUNC_MESSAGES=1`)
  environment variable to have all procs report, or can set UW_NO_FUNC_MESSAGES
  (`export UW_NO_FUNC_MESSAGES=1`) to disable these messages altogether
  for minimal filesystem noise. 
* Complete `long` type SwarmVariable implementation. Specifically, `evaluate()` 
  methods now work for this data type. 

Deprecations:
* Raijin install instructions removed.
