Modules found in 'unsupported' have been contributed to the underworld2 code.
These modules are not covered by the testing system, may contain additional python
dependencies, are not yet well documented, are not guaranteed to work with every
mesh type, may be limited to special cases (e.g. only 2D, only Cartesian) and
may never become supported.
