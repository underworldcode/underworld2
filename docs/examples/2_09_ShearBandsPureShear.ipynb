    "\n",
    "   1) This notebook also introduces Lagrangian integration with higher order elements. In this case it is necessary to  manually introduce the swarm population manager and explicitly call for the re-population of the elements after the particles have been advected.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2) The mesh is deformed to follow the moving boundaries. This is an ALE problem in which the material history attached to the particles and the boundary-deformation history is attached to the mesh. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   3) There is no thermal component to this notebook and hence no ALE correction for the moving mesh applies to the advection term.\n"
