The Jupyter notebook
--------------------

The Jupyter_ notebook provides a powerful
environment for the development and analysis of Underworld models.
*Underworld* and *UWGeodynamics* recommend using Jupyter notebooks
for the development of geodynamic models.

If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, we suggest you follow
a quick introduction `here <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipython/ipython-in-depth/master?filepath=binder/Index.ipynb>`_.

Where to find documentation?
----------------------------

Additional documentation and function specific
documentation can be find in the python doctrings.
You can acces them in the Jupyter_ notebook by prepending or
appending the method, variable or function with ``?``.

Design principles
-----------------

import *UWGeodynamics*
----------------------

*UWGeodynamics* can be imported as follow:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   ...

Visualization
--------------

We provide access to a wrapper around Lavavu_ , readily available from
Underworld.

The visualisation module can be imported as follow

.. code:: python

   >>> from UWGeodynamics import visualisation as vis

.. warning::

   Although many plotting modules are available, we strongly encourage people
   to use the *visualisation* module. It integrates very well inside the Jupyter_ notebook,
   is parallel safe, and can take Underworld function as arguments.


.. warning::

   We provide some basic examples. Look at the Lavavu_ documentation for more
   details.

Simple examples:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Plot Material Field* or any field / variable defined on the swarm (e.g. plasticstrain,
viscosityField, densityField etc.):

.. code:: python

   >>> from UWGeodynamics import visualisation as vis
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> Fig = vis.Figure(figsize=(1200,400), title="Material Field")
   >>> Fig.Points(Model.swarm, Model.materialField, fn_size=3.0)
   ...
   >>> Fig.show()
   >>> Fig.save("MaterialField.png")
   'MaterialField.png'

*Plot Temperature Field* or any field / variable defined on the mesh (e.g. temperature,
pressureField, velocityField, strainRateField) as well as projected swarm field /
variables (e.g. projMaterialField, projViscosityField etc.)

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> from UWGeodynamics import visualisation as vis

   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> Fig = vis.Figure(figsize=(1200,400), title="Temperature")
   >>> Fig.Surface(Model.mesh, GEO.dim(Model.temperature, u.degK))
   ...
   >>> Fig.show()
   >>> Fig.save("Temperature.png")
   'Temperature.png'

.. note::

   Fields can be dimensionalized using the GEO.dimensionalise function (see below)

*Plot Velocity Fields* or any vector field.

The example below plots a temperature field with the velocity vectors on top:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> from UWGeodynamics import visualisation as vis

   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> Fig = vis.Figure(figsize=(1200,400), title="Velocity")
   >>> Fig.Surface(Model.mesh, GEO.dim(Model.temperature, u.degK))
   ...
   >>> Fig.VectorArrows(Model.mesh, Model.velocityField)
   ...
   >>> Fig.show()
   >>> Fig.save("VelocityField.png")
   'VelocityField.png'

Working with units
------------------

*UWGeodynamics* uses Pint_, a
Python package to define, operate and manipulate **physical quantities**
(A numerical value with unit of measurement). Pint is a very powerful
package that handles conversion and operation between units.

We recommend using SI units but other systems are also available.

Pint_ **Unit Registry** can be used as follow:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.UnitRegistry

or simply

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u

You can have a quick overview of all the units available by hitting tab
after the ``.`` of the u object.

.. image:: img/tabtab.gif

Quantities can then be defined as follow:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> length = 100. * u.kilometre
   >>> width = 50. * u.kilometre
   >>> gravity = 9.81 * u.metre / u.second**2

Pint_ offers the possibility to append a prefix to the units.
1 million years can thus be defined as follow:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> length = 1.0 * u.megayear

.. note::

   Unit abbreviation is also possible :code:`u.km` is equivalent to :code:`u.kilometer`.
   You can refer to the Pint_ documentation for all abbreviations available.


Model Scaling
-------------

Model can be scaled using a series of scaling coefficients

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> GEO.scaling_coefficients
   ...

The default scaling coefficients are defined as follow:

+---------------+--------------+
| Dimension     | value        |
+===============+==============+
| [mass]        | 1.0 kilogram |
+---------------+--------------+
| [length]      | 1.0 metre    |
+---------------+--------------+
| [temperature] | 1.0 kelvin   |
+---------------+--------------+
| [time]        | 1.0 second   |
+---------------+--------------+
| [substance]   | 1.0 mole     |
+---------------+--------------+

The scaling value can be changed by accessing each scaling coefficient
as follow

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u

   >>> GEO.scaling_coefficients["[length]"] = 3. * u.kilometre
   >>> GEO.scaling_coefficients["[mass]"] = 4. * u.kilogram
   >>> GEO.scaling_coefficients["[temperature]"] = 273.15 * u.degK
   >>> GEO.scaling_coefficients["[time]"] = 300. * u.years

The unit entered are checked internally and an error is raised if the
units are incompatible. The value is automatically converted to the base
units (metre, second, degree, etc).

To scale a model, the user must define a series of characteristic
physical values and assign them to the scaling object.

Arguments with units will be scaled by the *UWGeodynamics* functions.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u

   >>> KL = 100 * u.kilometre
   >>> Kt = 1. * u.year
   >>> KM = 3000. * u.kilogram
   >>> KT = 1200. * u.degK

   >>> GEO.scaling_coefficients["[length]"] = KL
   >>> GEO.scaling_coefficients["[time]"] = Kt
   >>> GEO.scaling_coefficients["[mass]"]= KM
   >>> GEO.scaling_coefficients["[temperature]"] = KT

dimensionalise / non-dimensionalise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide 2 functions :code:`GEO.non_dimensionalise` and :code:`GEO.dimensionalise`
to convert between non-dimensional and dimensional values.
The function are also available respectively as :code:`GEO.nd` and
:code:`GEO.dim`.

**Example:**

1. define a length of 300 kilometres.
2. use the GEO.nd function to scale it.
3. convert the value back to SI units.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u

   >>> GEO.scaling_coefficients["[length]"] = 300. * u.kilometre

   >>> length = 300. * u.kilometre
   >>> scaled_length = GEO.nd(length)
   >>> print(scaled_length)
   1.0
   >>> length_metres = GEO.dimensionalise(scaled_length, u.metre)
   >>> print(length_metres)
   300000.0 meter


The Model object
----------------

The central element or “object” of the *UWGeodynamics* module is the
**Model** object.

It has several uses:

- It defines the extent and the outside geometry of your problem.
- It works as a container for the field variables.

It basically defines the universe on which you are going to apply
physical rules (Gravity field, boundary condition, composition,
temperature etc.) It is the equivalent of the box in which you would put
the sand and silicon if you were to build an analog experiment in a lab.
One important difference is that the “box” his not empty, it is
populated with particles that have already some properties. The
properties are changed by defining new materials.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model(elementRes=(64, 64),
   ...                   minCoord=(0. * u.kilometre, 0. * u.kilometre),
   ...                   maxCoord=(64. * u.kilometre, 64. * u.kilometre))

The Material object
-------------------

The *UWGeodynamics* module is designed around the idea of materials,
which are essentially a way to define physical properties across the
Model domain.

Predefined Material objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A library of predefined material is available through the
MaterialRegistry object:

.. code:: python

   from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

   materials_database = GEO.MaterialRegistry()


.. image:: /img/MaterialRegistry.gif

.. note::

   The MaterialRegistry object can import a database of materials
   from a json file by passing its path as argument.
   The `default json`__ file can be used as an example.

.. _default json: https://github.com/underworldcode/UWGeodynamics/blob/master/UWGeodynamics/ressources/Materials.json_



User defined
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Materials are defined using the **Material** object as follow:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

   >>> crust = GEO.Material(name="Crust")

Typing the name of the material in an empty cell will return a table
which summarizes the property of the material:

.. image:: img/Material1.png

As you can see, most of the property are undefined.

They are several ways to define the physical parametres of our Material.

-  The first one is to add them directly when creating the object
   itself:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> crust = GEO.Material(name="Crust", density=3000*u.kilogram/u.metre**3)

-  The second option is to change the property after creating the
   **Material**:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> crust = GEO.Material(name="Crust")
   >>> crust.density = 3000. * u.kilogram / u.metre **3

The second option is often easier to read.

.. warning::

   UWGeodynamics contains some basic dimensionality checks. Entering
   wrong units will raise an error

Material can be added to a model as follow:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> crust = Model.add_material(name="Crust")

Although optional, it is a good idea to give a **name** to the material.
The **Model.add_material** method will return a Material object. That
object is a python object that will then be used to define the property
of the material.

Material Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Material object comes with a series of attribute that can
be used to define its physical behavior.

.. table:: Materials attributes
  :widths: auto

  =================== ==================
  Name                    Description
  =================== ==================
  shape               Initial Geometrical Representation
  density             Density
  diffusivity         Thermal Diffusivity
  capacity            Thermal Capacity
  radiogenicHeatProd  Radiogenic Heat Production
  viscosity           Viscous behavior
  plasticity          Plastic behavior
  elasticity          Elastic behavior
  minViscosity        Minimum Viscosity allowed
  maxViscosity        Maximum Viscosity allowed
  stressLimiter       Maximum sustainable stress

  meltFractionLimit   Maximum Fraction of Melt
  viscosityChange     Change in Viscosity over Melt Fraction range
  viscosityChangeX1   Melt Fraction Range begin
  viscosityChangeX2   Melt Fraction Range end
  =================== ==================

**Examples**

.. code:: python

   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> Model.density = 200. * u.kg / u.m**3
   >>> myMaterial = GEO.Material(name="My Material")
   >>> myMaterial.density = 3000 * u.kilogram / u.metre**3
   >>> myMaterial.viscosity = 1e19 * u.pascal * u.second
   >>> myMaterial.radiogenicHeatProd = 0.7 * u.microwatt / u.metre**3
   >>> myMaterial.diffusivity = 1.0e-6 * u.metre**2 / u.second

Global properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The user can define attributes on the *Model* itself.
The values will be used as global values for materials with undefined
attributes

**Example**

.. code:: python

   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> Model.density = 200. * u.kg / u.m**3
   >>> myMaterial = GEO.Material(name="My Material")

The density of myMaterial will default to 200. kilogram / cubic metre unless
its *density* attribute is explicitly specified.


Material shape
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *shape* attribute essentially describes the initial
location of a material.
It is used to build the initial geometry of the model.

There are a range of available/pre-defined shapes

-  Layer (2D/3D)
-  Polygon (2D)
-  Box (2D)
-  Disk (2D)
-  Spheres (3D)
-  Annulus (2D)
-  CombinedShape (Combination of any of the above) (2D)
-  HalfSpace (3D)

   ...                   minCoord=(-1. * u.m, -1. * u.m, -50. * u.cm),
   ...                   maxCoord=(1. * u.m, 1. * u.m, 50. * u.cm))

   >>> sphereShape = GEO.shapes.Sphere(center=(0., 0., 20.*u.centimetre),
                                       radius=20. * u.centimetre))

**Annulus**

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> from UWGeodynamics import visualisation as vis

   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> annulus = GEO.shapes.Annulus(center=(35.*u.kilometre, 50.*u.kilometre),
   ...                              r1=5.*u.kilometre,
   ...                              r2=10.*u.kilometre)
   >>> material = Model.add_material(name="Material", shape=annulus)

   >>> Fig = vis.Figure(figsize=(400,400))
   >>> Fig.Points(Model.swarm, Model.materialField)
   >>> Fig.show()

.. image:: /img/annulus.png


**CombinedShape**

Several shapes can be combined to form a material shape:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> from UWGeodynamics import visualisation as vis

   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> disk1 = GEO.shapes.Disk(center=(10. * u.kilometre, 10. * u.kilometre),
   ...                         radius=10.*u.kilometre)
   >>> disk2 = GEO.shapes.Disk(center=(20. * u.kilometre, 20. * u.kilometre),
   ...                         radius=5.*u.kilometre)

   >>> shape = disk1 | disk2
   >>> material = Model.add_material(name="Material", shape=shape)

   >>> Fig = vis.Figure(figsize=(400,400))
   >>> Fig.Points(Model.swarm, Model.materialField)
   >>> Fig.show()

.. image:: /img/multishape.png

You can also take the intersection of some shapes:

.. code:: python

  >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
  >>> from UWGeodynamics import visualisation as vis

  >>> u = GEO.u
  >>> Model = GEO.Model()
  >>> disk1 = GEO.shapes.Disk(center=(32. * u.kilometre, 32. * u.kilometre),
  ...                         radius=10.*u.kilometre)
  >>> disk2 = GEO.shapes.Disk(center=(32. * u.kilometre, 22. * u.kilometre),
  ...                         radius=10.*u.kilometre)

  >>> shape = disk1 & disk2
  >>> material = Model.add_material(name="Material", shape=shape)

  >>> Fig = vis.Figure(figsize=(400,400))
  >>> Fig.Points(Model.swarm, Model.materialField)
  >>> Fig.show()

.. image:: /img/multishape-1.png

**HalfSpace**

HalfSpaces can be used to divide space in 2 domains. The divide is a plan defined
by its normal vector. The convention is to keep the domain opposite to direction
defined by the normal vector.

.. note::

   HalfSpaces can be combined to define 3D shapes / volumes.

.. image:: /img/3D_halfspaces.png

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> from UWGeodynamics import visualisation as vis

   >>> u = GEO.UnitRegistry

   >>> Model = GEO.Model(elementRes=(34, 34, 12),
   ...                   gravity=(0., 0., -9.81 * u.m / u.s**2),
   ...                   minCoord=(0. * u.km, 0. * u.km, -2880. * u.km),
   ...                   maxCoord=(9000. * u.km, 2000. * u.km, 20. * u.km))

   >>> halfspace1 = GEO.shapes.HalfSpace(normal=(-1.,0.,1.), origin=(4000. * u.km, 0. * u.km, -1000. * u.km))
   >>> halfspace2 = GEO.shapes.HalfSpace(normal=(0.,0.,1.), origin=(7000. * u.km, 1000. * u.km, 0. * u.km))
   >>> halfspace3 = GEO.shapes.HalfSpace(normal=(1.,0.,0.), origin=(9000. * u.km, 1000. * u.km, -500. * u.km))
   >>> halfspace4 = GEO.shapes.HalfSpace(normal=(0.,0.,-1.), origin=(6500. * u.km, 1000. * u.km, -1000. * u.km))

   >>> compositeShape = halfspace1 & halfspace2 & halfspace3 & halfspace4
   >>> polygon= Model.add_material(name="polygon", shape=compositeShape)

   >>> Fig = vis.Figure()
   >>> Fig.Points(Model.swarm, Model.materialField, cullface=False, opacity=1.)
   >>> Fig.Mesh(Model.mesh)
   >>> viewer = Fig.viewer(resolution=(1200,600))
   >>> viewer = Fig.viewer(axis=True)
   >>> viewer.rotatex(-70)
   >>> viewer.rotatey(-10)
   >>> viewer.window()


.. image:: /img/3D_halfspaces2.png

**Multiple materials**

You can add as many materials as needed:

.. code:: python

  >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
  >>> from UWGeodynamics import visualisation as vis

  >>> u = GEO.u
  >>> Model = GEO.Model()

  >>> shape = GEO.shapes.Layer(top=30.*u.kilometre, bottom=0.*u.kilometre)
  >>> material1 = Model.add_material(name="Material 1", shape=shape)

  >>> polygon = GEO.shapes.Polygon(vertices=[(10.* u.kilometre, 10.*u.kilometre),
  ...                                        (20.* u.kilometre, 35.*u.kilometre),
  ...                                        (35.* u.kilometre, 5.*u.kilometre)])

  >>> material2 = Model.add_material(name="Material 2", shape=polygon)

  >>> Fig = vis.Figure(figsize=(400,400))
  >>> Fig.Points(Model.swarm, Model.materialField, fn_size=3.)
  ...
  >>> Fig.show()
  >>> Fig.save("multiple_materials.png")
  'multiple_materials.png'

Temperature and Pressure dependent densities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Temperature and Pressure dependent densities can be assigned to a Material using
the ``GEO.LinearDensity`` function which calculates:

.. math::
   :label: linearDensity

   `\rho = \rho_0 (1 + (\beta * \delta P) - (\alpha * \delta T))`

where :math:`\rho` is the reference density, :math:`\beta` a factor, :math:`\delta P` the difference
between the pressure and the reference pressure, :math:`\alpha` is the thermal
expansivity and :math:`\delta T` is the difference between the temperature and the
reference temperature.

.. code:: python

  >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
  >>> u = GEO.u
  >>> Model = GEO.Model()

  >>> material1 = Model.add_material(name="Material 1", shape=shape)
  >>> material1.density = GEO.LinearDensity(reference_density=3370. * u.kilogram / u.metre**3,
  ...                                       thermalExpansivity= 2.8e-5 * u.kelvin**-1,
  ...                                       beta=1.0)

Rheologies
----------

Newtonian Rheology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A newtonian rheology can be applied by assigning a viscosity to a already defined material

.. code:: python

  >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

  >>> myMaterial = GEO.Material(name="Newtonian Material")
  >>> myMaterial.viscosity = 1e19 * u.pascal * u.second

Non-Newtonian Rheology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deformation of materials on long timescale is predominantly achieved
through viscous diffusion and dislocation creep. Those processes can be
expressed using the following equation:

.. math::

   \eta_{\text{eff}}^{vcreep} = \frac{1}{2}A^{\frac{-1}{n}}
   \dot{\epsilon}^{\frac{(1-n)}{n}}d^{\frac{m}{n}}\exp{\left(\frac{E + PV}{nRT}\right)}

with `A` the prefactor, :math:`\dot{\epsilon}` the square root of the second invariant of the
deviatoric strain rate tensor, `d` the grain size, `p` the grain size exponent, `E` the
activation energy, `P` the pressure, `V` the activation volume, `n` the stress exponent,
`R` the Gas Constant and `T` the temperature.

*UWGeodynamics* provides a library of commonly used Viscous Creep Flow Laws.
These can be accessed using the `GEO.ViscousCreepRegistry`:

.. image:: /img/ViscousCreepRegistry.gif


.. note::

   The ViscousCreepRegistry object can import a database of rheologies
   from a json file by passing its path as argument.
   The `default json`__ file can be find here and can be used as an example.

__ https://github.com/underworldcode/UWGeodynamics/blob/master/UWGeodynamics/ressources/ViscousRheologies.json_

**Example:**

.. code:: python

  >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
  >>> material = GEO.Material(name="Material")

  >>> rh = GEO.ViscousCreepRegistry()
  >>> material.viscosity = rh.Wet_Quartz_Dislocation_Gleason_and_Tullis_1995

You can scale viscosity by using a multiplier.
For example to make the **Gleason and Tullis, 1995** rheology
30 times stronger you can do:

.. code:: python

  >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
  >>> material = GEO.Material(name="Material")

  >>> rh = GEO.ViscousCreepRegistry()
  >>> material.viscosity = 30 * rh.Wet_Quartz_Dislocation_Gleason_and_Tullis_1995

The user can of course define their own ViscousCreep rheology.

.. code:: python

  >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
  >>> viscosity = GEO.ViscousCreep(preExponentialFactor=1.0,
  ...                              stressExponent=1.0,
  ...                              activationVolume=0.,
  ...                              activationEnergy=200 * u.kilojoules,
  ...                              waterFugacity=0.0,
  ...                              grainSize=0.0,
  ...                              meltFraction=0.,
  ...                              grainSizeExponent=0.,
  ...                              waterFugacityExponent=0.,
  ...                              meltFractionFactor=0.0,
  ...                              f=1.0)

Single parametres can then be modified.

.. code:: python

   viscosity.activationEnergy = 300. * u.kilojoule

Composite Viscosity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Material viscosity can be assigned a combination of viscosities.
The effective viscosity is calculated as the harmonic mean of
all viscosities.

This is useful to combine diffusion and dislocation creep:

.. math::

   \eta_{\text{eff}}^{vcreep} = \left(\frac{1}{\eta_{\text{eff}}^{\text{diff}}} +
                                \frac{1}{\eta_{\text{eff}}^{\text{disl}}}\right)


.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

   >>> viscosity1 = GEO.ViscousCreep(preExponentialFactor=1.0,
   ...                              stressExponent=1.0,
   ...                              activationVolume=0.,
   ...                              activationEnergy=200 * u.kilojoules,
   ...                              waterFugacity=0.0,
   ...                              grainSize=0.0,
   ...                              meltFraction=0.,
   ...                              grainSizeExponent=0.,
   ...                              waterFugacityExponent=0.,
   ...                              meltFractionFactor=0.0,
   ...                              f=1.0)


   >>> viscosity2 = GEO.ViscousCreep(preExponentialFactor=1.0,
   ...                              stressExponent=1.0,
   ...                              activationVolume=0.,
   ...                              activationEnergy=200 * u.kilojoules,
   ...                              waterFugacity=0.0,
   ...                              grainSize=0.0,
   ...                              meltFraction=0.,
   ...                              grainSizeExponent=0.,
   ...                              waterFugacityExponent=0.,
   ...                              meltFractionFactor=0.0,
   ...                              f=1.0)
   >>> combined_viscosity = GEO.CompositeViscosity([viscosity1, viscosity2])


Plastic Behavior (Yield)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plastic yielding can be added and will result in rescaling the
effective viscosity for a stress limited to the yield stress of the
material.

The effective plastic viscosity is given by:

.. math::

   \eta_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\sigma_y}{2\dot{\epsilon}}

Where :math:`\dot{\epsilon}` is the second invariant of the strain rate tensor
defined as :math:`\dot{\epsilon}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\dot{\epsilon}_{ij}\dot{\epsilon}_{ij}}`
The yield value :math:`\sigma_y` is defined using a Drucker-Prager yield-criterion:

.. math::
   :label: druckerprager

   \sigma_y = C \cos\phi + \sin\phi P \quad \text{(2D)}

   \sigma_y = \frac{6C\cos\phi}{\sqrt3(3-\sin\phi)} +
              \frac{6\sin\phi P}{\sqrt3(3-\sin\phi)} \quad \text{(3D)}


Setting the friction angle :math:`\phi=0` gives the von Mises Criterion.
In 2D, equation :eq:`druckerprager` corresponds to the Mohr-Coulomb criterion,
while in 3D it circumscribes the Mohr-Coulomb yield surface.

Linear cohesion and friction weakening can be added by defining their
initial and final values over a range of accumulated plastic strain.

As with Viscous Creep, we also provide a registry of commmonly used
plastic behaviors.
They can be accessed using the `GEO.PlasticityRegistry` registry.

.. image:: /img/PlasticityRegistry.gif

.. note::

   The PlasticityRegistry object can import a database of plasticity
   from a json file by passing its path as argument.
   The `default json`__ file can be find here and can be used as an example.

__ https://github.com/underworldcode/UWGeodynamics/blob/master/UWGeodynamics/ressources/PlasticRheologies.json_

Users can define their own parametres:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> material = Model.add_material()

   >>> material.plasticity = GEO.DruckerPrager(
   ...     cohesion=10. * u.megapascal,
   ...     cohesionAfterSoftening=10. * u.megapascal,
   ...     frictionCoefficient = 0.3,
   ...     frictionAfterSoftening = 0.2,
   ...     epsilon1=0.5,
   ...     epsilon2=1.5)


Viscous Creep and Plastic yielding are combined by assuming that they act
in parallel as independent processes. The effective viscoplastic viscosity
is calculated as:

.. math::

   \eta_{\text{eff}^{\text{vp}}} = \min{(\eta_{\text{eff}}^{\text{vcreep}},
   \eta_{\text{eff}}^{\text{pl}})}



Elasticity
~~~~~~~~~~

Elastic behavior can be added to a material:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> material = Model.add_material()

   >>> material.elasticity(shear_modulus=10e9 * u.pascal,
                           observation_time=10000 * u.year)

Simple phase change
-------------------

One can change the property of one material to another depending on
some time, tepmerature, pressure etc. criteria.
This is not a phase change sensu-stricto but this allows for simple
change such as transition from mantle to oceanic-crust behavior or
simply air to water...

.. warning::

   Phase changes can only occur between predefined material. If you plan to
   add a material during the Model run, you will have to define it beforehand.

In the following example we change air into water when the air particles
move below the 0. level.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> air = Model.add_material(name="air")
   >>> water = Model.add_material(name="water")
   >>> air.phase_changes = GEO.PhaseChange((Model.y < 0.), water.index)

The above example essentially fills the basins with water. For such a specific
purpose you can use the ``WaterFill`` class.

.. code:: python

   >>> air = Model.add_material(name="air")
   >>> water = Model.add_material(name="water")
   >>> air.phase_changes = GEO.WaterFill(sealevel=0., result=water)

This is easier to read but equivalent.


Melt
----

Materials can be assigned a ``Solidus`` and a ``Liquidus`` defined as polynomial
function of temperature. This allows to calculate the fraction of melt present in
the material.

.. warning::

   There is no seggregation of the melt from its source.

A registry of Solidii and Liquidii are available:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

   >>> solidii = GEO.SolidusRegistry()
   >>> crust_solidus = solidii.Crustal_Solidus

   >>> liquidii = GEO.LiquidusRegistry()
   >>> crust_liquidus = liquidii.Crustal_Liquidus

The percentage of melt results in a linear decrease of the viscosity of a factor
``viscosityChange`` over the ``viscosityChangeX1`` - ``viscosityChangeX2``
melt fraction interval.

The latent heat of fusion is embedded in the energy equation and affects the
temperature field of the Model.

The meltExpansion factor affects the density of the materials and equation
:eq:`linearDensity` becomes:

.. math::

   :label: linearDensityMelt

   `\rho = \rho_0 (1 + (\beta * \delta P) - (\alpha * \delta T) - \gamma F) `

with `\gamma` the factor of melt expansion and `F` the fraction of melt.

The following example prescribes a decrease in viscosity of 3 order of
magnitude over a range of 0.15 to 0.30 fraction of melt.
The fraction of the melt is limited to 0.3

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> continentalcrust = Model.add_material(name="Continental Crust")
   >>> continentalcrust.radiogenicHeatProd = 7.67e-7 * u.watt / u.meter**3
   >>> continentalcrust.density  = 2720. * u.kilogram / u.metre**3

   >>> continentalcrust.add_melt_modifier(crust_solidus, crust_liquidus,
   ...                                    latentHeatFusion=250.0 * u.kilojoules / u.kilogram / u.kelvin,
   ...                                    meltFraction=0.,
   ...                                    meltFractionLimit=0.3,
   ...                                    meltExpansion=0.13,
   ...                                    viscosityChangeX1 = 0.15,
   ...                                    viscosityChangeX2 = 0.30,
   ...                                    viscosityChange = 1e-3
   ...                                   )
   ...

Mechanical Boundary Conditions
-------------------------------

Mechanical boundary conditions are a critical part of any
geodynamic model design. In what follows, we quickly detail the options
available for defining the mechanical boundary conditions in Underworld using the
UWGeodynamics module.

Questions like how to define boundary conditions and to make sure that those are
consistent are beyond the scope of this manual.

We will define a simple model for the sake of the example.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

   >>> u = GEO.u

   >>> Model = GEO.Model(elementRes=(64, 64),
   ...                   minCoord=(0. * u.kilometre, 0. * u.kilometre),
   ...                   maxCoord=(64. * u.kilometre, 64. * u.kilometre))

Kinematic boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kinematic boundary conditions are set using the **set_velocityBCs** method.
Conditions are defined for each wall (left, right, bottom, top, back and front (3D only)).
For each wall, the user must define the condition for each degree of freedom
(2 in 2D (x,y), 3 in 3D (x,y,z).

if :math:`V` is a vector :math:`(V_x, V_y, V_z)` that we
want to apply on the left wall, the *left* parametre must be defined as
:code:`left=[Vx, Vy, Vz]`.

In the following example we set the boundary condition to be:

-  left wall: :math:`V_x = -1.0 \text{cm / yr}`,
   :math:`Vy = None`
-  right wall: :math:`V_x = 1.0 \text{cm / yr}`, :math:`Vy=None`
-  bottom wall: :math:`V_x = None`, :math:`V_y= 0.` (free slip)

It is an extension model with a total rate of extension equal to 2.0
centimetre / year. No :math:`V_x` is prescribed at the bottom, while
:math:`V_y` is set to :math:`0.` no material will be able to enter or
leave the model domain from that side. The material is free to move
vertically along the side walls.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> Model.set_velocityBCs(left=[1.0*u.centimetre/u.year, None],
   ...                       right=[-1.0*u.centimetre/u.year, None],
   ...                       bottom=[None, 0.],
   ...                       top=[None,0.])
   ...

.. image:: /img/mechanicalBCs1.png

3D
^^

Defining boundary conditions for a 3D model is no different than above.
The user must define the velocity components with 3 degree of freedom
instead of 2.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model(elementRes=(16, 16, 16),
   ...                   minCoord=(0. * u.kilometre, 0. * u.kilometre, 0. * u.kilometre),
   ...                   maxCoord=(64. * u.kilometre, 64. * u.kilometre, 64. * u.kilometre))

   >>> Model.set_velocityBCs(left=[1.0*u.centimetre/u.year, None, 0.],
   ...                        right=[-1.0*u.centimetre/u.year, None, 0.],
   ...                        bottom=[None, None, 0.],
   ...                        top=[None, None, 0.],
   ...                        front=[None, 0., None],
   ...                        back=[None, 0., None])
   ...

Velocity varying along a wall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At times it is necessary to define a velocity only for a section of a
wall and or varying velocities along that wall.

An Underworld function can be passed as a condition.

As an example, we will apply a velocity of :math:`5.0\text{cm/yr}` for
the part of the left wall below 32 kilometre. Velocity is set to be
:math:`1.0\text{cm/yr}` above.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> conditions = [(Model.y < GEO.nd(32 * u.kilometre), GEO.nd(5.0 * u.centimetre/u.year)),
                     (True, GEO.nd(1.0*u.centimetre/u.year))]

   >>> function = GEO.uw.fn.branching.conditional(conditions)

   >>> Model.set_velocityBCs(left=[function, None],
   ...                       right=[-1.0*u.centimetre/u.year, None],
   ...                       bottom=[None, 10.*u.megapascal],
   ...                       top=[None,0.])
   ...

.. image:: /img/mechanicalBCs2.png


Stress Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stress conditions can be applied to the boundaries using the
**set_stressBCs** method:

In the following example we apply a stress of 200.0 megapascal to the
bottom of our model:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> Model.set_stressBCs(bottom=[None, 200. * u.megapascal])
   ...

Note that you will have to make sure that kinematic and stress conditions
are compatible.

Frictional Boundaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Frictional Boundaries can be set as follow:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> Model.set_frictional_boundary(left=frictionCoeff,
   ...                               right=frictionCoeff,
   ...                               bottom=frictionCoeff,
   ...                               top=frictionCoeff,
   ...                               thickness=3)
   ...

Where the *left*, *right*, *top*, *bottom* parametres indicate the side to which you
apply a frictional boundary condition on. *frictionCoeff* is the friction coefficient
(tangent of the friction angle in radians). *thickness* is the thickness of the boundary
in number of elements.

Isostasy
~~~~~~~~

Isostasy is an important concept in geodynamics. It is essentially a
consequence of the redistribution of mass within a deforming Earth. One
important limitation of our geodynamic model is that we model special
cases inside rectangular boxes while earth is actually a sphere. One may
however need to provide a way to maintain the volume / mass inside the
domain in order to mimic isostasy. There is no ideal way to model
isostasy in a boxed model, it is however possible to approach isostasy
using a support condition.

Options are to:

-  Balance flows using a kinematic condition at the base of the model.
-  Balance flows using a stress condition at the base of the model.
-  Balance flows along the sides.

Lecode Isostasy (kinematic)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Lecode Isostasy submodule provides a way to model isostatic support
at the base of the model. It calculates the velocity to apply at the
base of each elemental column. It applies the principles of Airy
isostatic model by approximating the weight of each column. The
calculation is done dynamically and velocities will change from one step
to the next. It is a good option to use in most cases.

The option can be used by creating a LecodeIsostasy object using the
``GEO.LecodeIsostasy`` class. The object requires the index of the
material of reference (the material number). One can apply an average
velocity (calculated across each column base) using the ``average``
parameter (default to False).

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> Model.set_velocityBCs(left=[1.0*u.centimetre/u.year, None],
   ...                       right=[-1.0*u.centimetre/u.year, None],
   ...                       bottom=[None, GEO.LecodeIsostasy(reference_mat=mantle)],
   ...                       top=[None,0.])
   ...

Traction Condition (stress)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another approach to model isostasy is to defined a certain stress at the base of
the model. This is done using units of stress (derived SI units =
pascal). The model will then maintain the denfined stress by adjusting the flow
across the border/boundary.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> Model.set_stressBCs(bottom=[None, 10.*u.megapascal])
   ...

Lithostatic Pressure Condition (stress)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The lithostatic pressure field can be passed as a boundary condition (stress)

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> Model.set_stressBCs(left=[-Model.lithostatic_pressureField, None])
   ...


Thermal Boundary Conditions
---------------------------

Absolute temperatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting the temperature at the top of a model to be
:math:`500 \text{kelvin}` at the top and :math:`1600 \text{kelvin}` at
the bottom is done as follow.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> Model.set_temperatureBCs(top=500. * u.degK, bottom=1600. * u.degK)
   ...

You can of course define temperatures on the sidewalls:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> Model.set_temperatureBCs(right=500. * u.degK, left=1600. * u.degK)
   ...

**Fix the temperature of a Material**

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> Model.set_temperatureBCs(top=500. * u.degK,
   ...                          bottom=-0.022 * u.milliwatt / u.metre**2,
   ...                          bottom_material=Model,
   ...                          materials=[(air, 273. * u.Kelvin)])
   ...

.. Note::

   Model inflow is negative, outflow is positive.


**Fix the temperature of internal nodes**

You can assign a temperature to a list of nodes by passing a list of
node indices (global).

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> nodes = [0, 1, 2]
   >>> Model.set_temperatureBCs(top=500. * u.degK,
   ...                          bottom=-0.022 * u.milliwatt / u.metre**2,
   ...                          bottom_material=Model,
   ...                          nodeSets=[(273. * u.Kelvin, nodes)])
   ...

Heat flux
~~~~~~~~~

Heat Flux can be assign as follow:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

   >>> u = GEO.u

   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> Material = Model.add_material(shape=GEO.Layer(top=Model.top,
   ...                                               bottom=Model.bottom)
   >>> Model.set_heatFlowBCs(bottom=(-0.22 * u.milliwatt / u.metre**2,
   ...                               Material))
   ...

Model initialization
--------------------

Initialization of the pressure and temperature fields is done by using the

``Model.init_model`` method.

The default behavior is to not initialise the pressure nor the temperature fields.

You can initialise the fields by passing an Underworld function or a Mesh variable.
You can initialise the temperature field to steady-state using the "steady-state" value.
Yuo can initialise the pressure field to be lithostatic using the "lithostatic" value.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u

   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> Model.density = 2000. * u.kilogram / u.metre**3
   >>> Model.init_model(temperature="steady-state", pressure="lithostatic")
   ...


.. warning::

   The lithostatic pressure calculation relies on a regular quadratic mesh.
   Most of the time this is fine for model initialization as models often
   starts on a regular mesh. However, this will not work on a deformed mesh

Running the Model
-----------------

Once your model is set up and initialized. You can run it using the
*Model.run_for* method.

You have 2 options:

1. Run the model for some given number of steps:

.. code:: python

   Model.run_for(nstep=10)

1. Specify an endTime

.. code:: python

   Model.run_for(endTime=1.0* u.megayears)

which is equivalent to

.. code:: python

   Model.run_for(1.0*u.megayears)

Specify a timestep
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UWGeodynamics calculates the time step automatically based on some
numerical stability criteria. You can force a specific time step or
force the time step to be constant throughout

.. code:: python

   Model.run_for(1.0*u.megayears, dt=10000. * u.years)


Saving data
~~~~~~~~~~~

As your model is running you will need to save the results to files.

The *Model.run_for* method provides a series of arguments to help you
save the results at some regular intervals and/or specified times. You can define:

1. A *checkpoint_interval*

.. code:: python

   Model.run_for(endTime=1.0*u.megayears,
                 checkpoint_interval=0.1* u.megayears)

**The value passed to the checkpoint_interval must have units of time**
1. A list of checkpoint times:

.. code:: python

   Model.run_for(endTime=1.0*u.megayears,
                    checkpoint_interval=0.1* u.megayears,
                    checkpoint_times=[0.85 * u.megayears,
                                      0.21 * u.megayears])

**This can be used together or without the checkpoint_interval**

UWGeodynamics will save all the fields defined in the
``GEO.rcParams[“default.outputs”]`` list. You can change that list before
running the model.

Checkpointing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By checkpointing we mean saving the data required to restart the Model.
This includes the *mesh*, the *swarm* and all the associated variables.

However, as the swarm and the swarm variables can be very large and can
take a lot of space on disk, the user can decide to save them only every
second, third, fourth etc. checkpoint step.

This is done passing the *restart_checkpoint* argument to the
*Model.run_for* function:

.. code:: python

   Model.run_for(endTime=1.0*u.megayears,
                 checkpoint_interval=0.1* u.megayears,
                 restart_checkpoint=2

By default, the swarm and the swarm variables are saved every time the
model reaches a checkpoint time (``restart_checkpoint=1``).


Pre / Post-solve hook functions
-------------------------------

We provide 2 access points for injection of custom functions.

.. code:: python

   def my_functionA():
       # do something
       print("Hello, I am running a pre-solve function")
       return

   def my_functionB():
       # do something
       print("Hello, I am running a post-solve function")
       return

   Model.pre_solve_function["A"] = my_functionA
   Model.post_solve_function["B"] = my_functionB

Note that the functions are executed in the order they were defined.


Solver Callback functions
-------------------------

User can provide custom callback functions to the solver itself. The function(s) will be executed
after each solve. This gives the possibility to tweak the behaviour of the non-linear iterations loop.


.. code:: python

   def my_function()
       # do something
       print("Hello, This is a solver callback")

   Model.callback_function["my_function"] = my_function



Restarting the Model
--------------------

When checkpointing a model only the mesh, swarms their associates variables
are explicitely saved. Since the model state is not explicitly saved,
thus the user needs to recreate the **Model** object before restarting it.
In practice, this means the user must run all commands preceding the
**Model.run_for** command.

The user can then restart a model using the **restartStep** and
**restartDir** arguments:

-  **restartStep** is *None* by default.
   The step numbercyou want to restart from. If -1, restarts from the last available
   step in **restartDir**

-  **restartDir** is the folder where the program should look for
   previously saved data or checkpoints. It is set to **Model.outputs** by default.

.. code:: python

   from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

   u = GEO.u

   Model = GEO.Model(elementRes=(64, 64),
                     minCoord=(0. * u.kilometre, 0. * u.kilometre),
                     maxCoord=(64. * u.kilometre, 64. * u.kilometre))

   # Default (restart, restartDir are optional in this case)
   Model.run_for(2.0 * u.megayears, restartStep=-1, restartDir="your_restart_directory")

   # Restart from step 10
   Model.run_for(2.0 * u.megayears, restartStep=10, restartDir="your_restart_directory")

   # Overwrite existing outputs
   Model.run_for(2.0 * u.megayears, restartStep=False)

Model outputs
-------------

All mesh variables / fields defined in the ``GEO.rcParams["default.outputs"]``
are saved as HDF5_ files to the ``outputDir`` directory at every output times.
An XMF file is provided and can be used to open the files in Paraview_

All variables required for a restart are saved as HDF5_ files to the
``outputDir`` directory at each checkpoint time.
An XMF file is also provided.

Passive Tracers and tracked fields are also saved as HDF5_ files at every output
and checkpoint times.
Each of then has an associated XMF file.

Parallel run
------------

A Model can be run on multiple processors:

You first need to convert your jupyter notebook to a python script:

.. code:: bash

  jupyter nbconvert --to python my_script.ipynb


You can then run the python script as follow:

.. code:: bash

  mpirun -np 4 python my_script.py


.. warning::

   Underworld and UWGeodynamics functions are parallel safe and
   can be run on multiple CPUs. This might not be the case with other
   python libraries you might be interested in using with your Model.
   For example, matplotlib plots will not work in parallel and must
   be processed in serial.
   *Tutorial 1* has examples of matplotlib plots which are only done
   on the rank 0 CPU.


Passive Tracers
---------------

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> import numpy as np

   >>> u = GEO.u

   >>> Model = GEO.Model()
   >>> npoints = 1000
   >>> coords = np.ndarray((npoints, 2))
   >>> coords[:, 0] = np.linspace(GEO.nd(Model.minCoord[0]), GEO.nd(Model.maxCoord[0]), npoints)
   >>> coords[:, 1] = GEO.nd(32. * u.kilometre)
   >>> Model.add_passive_tracers(vertices=coords)

You can pass a list of centroids to the `Model.add_passive_tracers` method.
In that case, the coordinates of the passive tracers are relative to the
position of the centroids. The pattern is repeated around each centroid.

.. code:: python

    >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> u = GEO.u
    >>> Model = GEO.Model()
    >>> cxpos = np.linspace(GEO.nd(20*u.kilometer), GEO.nd(40*u.kilometer),5)
    >>> cypos = np.linspace(GEO.nd(20*u.kilometer), GEO.nd(40*u.kilometer),5)
    >>> cxpos, cypos = np.meshgrid(cxpos, cypos)
    >>> coords_centroid = np.ndarray((cxpos.size, 2))
    >>> coords_centroid[:, 0] = cxpos.ravel()
    >>> coords_centroid[:, 1] = cypos.ravel()
    >>>
    >>> coords = np.zeros((1, 2))
    >>> Model.add_passive_tracers(vertices=coords, centroids=coords_centroid)


We provide a function to create circles on a grid:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO

   >>> coords = GEO.circles_grid(radius = 2.0 * u.kilometer,
   ...                           minCoord=[Model.minCoord[0], lowercrust.bottom],
   ...                           maxCoord=[Model.maxCoord[0], 0.*u.kilometer])

Tracking Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Passive tracers can be used to track values of fields at specific location
through time. Tracking projected fields (fields with the prefix ``proj``) is discouraged
as these fields can't be restarted after checkpointing. Instead, one can track the 
non projected field, i.e. `projViscosityField`, `viscosityField`)

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> import numpy as np

   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> Model = GEO.Model()

   >>> npoints = 1000
   >>> coords = np.ndarray((npoints, 2))
   >>> coords[:, 0] = np.linspace(GEO.nd(Model.minCoord[0]), GEO.nd(Model.maxCoord[0]), npoints)
   >>> coords[:, 1] = GEO.nd(32. * u.kilometre)
   >>> Model.add_passive_tracers(name="p1", vertices=coords)

   >>> Model.p1_tracers.add_tracked_field(Model.pressureField,
                                          name="tracers_press",
                                          units=u.megapascal,
                                          dataType="float")
   >>> Model.p1_tracers.add_tracked_field(Model.strainRateField,
                                          name="tracers_strainRate",
                                          units=1.0/u.second,
                                          dataType="float")

Surface Processes
-----------------

A range of basic surface processes function are available from the
*surfaceProcesses* submodule. Surface processes are turned on once you
have passed a valid surface processes function to the
``surfaceProcesses`` method of the ``Model`` object.

Example:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> air = GEO.Material()
   >>> sediment = GEO.Material()
   >>> Model.surfaceProcesses = GEO.surfaceProcesses.SedimentationThreshold(
   ...     air=[air], sediment=[sediment], threshold=0. * u.metre)

Three simple function are available:

1. Total Erosion Above Threshold (``ErosionThreshold``).
2. Total Sedimentation Below Threshold (``SedimentationThreshold``)
3. Combination of the 2 above. (``ErosionAndSedimentationThreshold``)

Erosion and sedimentation rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adds an erosion and sedimentation rate to the surface. A pre-defined vertical co-ordinate (surfaceElevation) needs to be defined to stop erodion below that level and sedimenation above it.

Example:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> air = GEO.Material()
   >>> sediment = GEO.Material()
   >>> Model.surfaceProcesses = GEO.surfaceProcesses.velocitySurface_2D(
   ...     airIndex=air.index, sedimentIndex=sediment.index,
   ...     sedimentationRate= 2.*u.millimeter / u.year, erosionRate= 2.*u.millimeter / u.year,
   ...     surfaceElevation=0.*u.kilometer,
   ...     surfaceArray = coords)

 Diffusive surface
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Adds a linear diffusive surface to the model.

 Example:

 .. code:: python

    >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
    >>> u = GEO.u
    >>> air = GEO.Material()
    >>> sediment = GEO.Material()
    >>> Model.surfaceProcesses = GEO.surfaceProcesses.diffusiveSurface_2D(
    ...     airIndex=air.index, sedimentIndex=sediment.index,
    ...     D= 1000.0*u.meter**2/u.year,
    ...     surfaceArray = coords)



Coupling with Badlands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UWGeodynamics provides a way to couple an Underworld model to Badlands_.

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> u = GEO.u
   >>> air = GEO.Material()
   >>> sediment = GEO.Material()
   >>> Model.surfaceProcesses = GEO.surfaceProcesses.Badlands(
   ...     airIndex=[air.index], sedimentIndex=sediment.index,
   ...     XML="ressources/badlands.xml", resolution=1. * u.kilometre,
   ...     checkpoint_interval=0.01 * u.megayears)

This will allow communication between the *UWGeodynamics* model and the *Badlands*
surface processes model. Badlands input parameters must be defined inside
an XML file as described in the module documentation_.
We provide an `XML example`_.
The resulting Model is a 2-way coupled thermo-mechanical model with
surface processes, where the velocity field retrieved from the thermo-mechanical
model is used to advect the surface in the Surface Processes Model. The
surface in subjected to erosion and deposition.  The distribution of materials
in the thermomechanical model is then updated.

Users must define a list of material describing the air layers (usually, air and
sticky air). It is also require to define an `UWGeodynamics.Material` object
describing the sediment that will be deposited. The index of the Material is passed
to the `surfaceProcesses` function. Users can also provide an `Underworld` function
returning an index of an existing `UWGeodynamics.Material`.

It is recommended to use a higher spatial resolution in the surface processes
model than in the thermo-mechanical model.

.. note::

    When the Thermomechanical model is 2D, the velocity field at the surface
    is extrapolated in the 3D dimension and the resulting model is a T or 2.5D
    model (symmetric regional uplift).
    If the thermomechanical model is 3D the coupling is done in 3D.

Deforming Mesh
--------------

Uniaxial deformation can be turned on using the ``Model.mesh_advector()``
method. The method takes an ``axis`` argument which defines the direction
of deformation (x=0, y=1, z=2)

.. code:: python

   >>> Model.mesh_advector(axis=0)

Element are stretched or compressed uniformly across the model.
This will result in a change in resolution with time.

Top Free surface
----------------

Free surface can be turned on using the ``Model.freesurface`` switch.

.. code:: python

   >>> Model.freesurface = True

.. warning::

   No stabilization algorithm has been implemented yet.


Dynamic rc settings
-------------------

You can dynamically change the default rc settings in a python script or
interactively from the python shell. All of the rc settings are stored
in a dictionary-like variable called `UWGeodynamics.rcParams`, which
is global to the UWGeodynamics package. rcParams can be modified
directly, for example:

.. code:: python

   >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
   >>> GEO.rcParams['solver'] = "mumps"
   >>> GEO.rcParams['penalty'] = 1e6


The ``UWGeodynamics.rcdefaults`` command will restore the standard
UWGeodynamics default settings.

There is some degree of validation when setting the values of rcParams,
see ``UWGeodynamics.rcsetup`` for details.

The ``uwgeodynamicsrc`` file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UWGeodynamics uses ``uwgeodynamicsrc`` configuration files to customize
all kinds of properties, which we call ``rc settings`` or
``rc parameters``. For now, you can control the defaults of a limited
set of properties.

UWGeodynamics looks for ``uwgeodynamicsrc`` in four locations, in the following order:

1. ``uwgeodynamicsrc`` in the current working directory, usually used
   for specific customizations for a particular model setup that you
   do not want to apply elsewhere.

2. ``$UWGEODYNAMICSRC`` if it is a file, else
   ``$UWGEODYNAMICSRC/uwgeodynamicsrc``.

3. It next looks in a user-specific place, depending on your platform:

   -  On Linux, it looks in ``.config/uwgeodynamics/uwgeodynamicsrc``
      (or ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/uwgeodynamics/uwgeodynamicsrc``) if you’ve
      customized your environment.

   -  On other platforms, it looks in
      ``.uwgeodynamics/uwgeodynamicsrc``.

4. ``{INSTALL}/UWGeodynamics/uwgeo-data/uwgeodynamicsrc``, where
   ``{INSTALL}`` is something like ``/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages``
   on Linux, and maybe ``C:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages`` on Windows.
   Every time you install UWgeodynamics, this file will be overwritten, so
   if you want your customizations to be saved, please move this file to
   your user-specific directory.

To display where the currently active ``uwgeodynamicsrc`` file was
loaded from, one can do the following:

.. code:: python

     >>> from underworld import UWGeodynamics as GEO
     >>> GEO.uwgeodynamics_fname()
     '/workspace/user_data/UWGeodynamics/UWGeodynamics/uwgeo-data/uwgeodynamicsrc'
