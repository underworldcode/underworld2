### Summary

Underworld is an open-source, parallel, particle-in-cell, finite element geodynamics code [1,2,3]. The development team is currently based at the University of Melbourne, and at Monash University with funding from [AuScope](http://www.auscope.org) and the [Australian Research Council](http://www.arc.gov.au).

### History

Underworld has been in development since 2003. It has always been released under open-source licence with the copyright held by the organisations contributing to its development. The underworld team has changed considerably during that time. For detailed information on the individuals and organisations contributing to the code, it is necessary to consult the repository history data and commit logs. Historical information beyond that found within the current repository is available upon request.
